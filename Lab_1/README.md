# Assignment 1 

- [Description](./doc/description.pdf)

## Requirements
**Note**: Present and discuss your solutions with a teacher / lab assistant when all tasks are done, i.e., before submitting on Canvas.
When you have discussed your solutions orally, prepare and submit a tar-file or zip-file containing:
* Source code: The source-code for working solutions to the tasks in Section 5. Specifically, you shall submit your wellcommented source code for Task 10 and Task 11.

* Corresponding Makefile(s), or a text-file describing how to compile the respective projects / tasks.

* Written report: You should write a short report (approximately 2-3 pages) describing, for each task, your implementations, the answers to the questions in the tasks, and your measurements (results), as outline below. The format of the report must be pdf.

  * Implementation: A general description of your parallel implementations, i.e., you should describe how you have partitioned the work between the threads and cpus, how the data structures are organized, etc.

  * Measurements: You should provide execution times for two cases: (i) the sequential version of the application, and (ii) the parallel version of the application running on 16 cpus (i.e., cores), using as many threads as you like. The data set sizes for the tasks are: Gaussian elimination using a 2048 × 2048 matrix, and Quicksort using an array with 64 ∗ 220 items. Further, analyze and discuss your results.

All material (except the code given to you in this assignment) must be produced by the laboratory group alone.
The examiner may contact you within a week, if he/she needs some oral clarifications on your code or report. In this case, all
group members must be present at that oral occasion.
